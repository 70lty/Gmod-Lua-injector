# ZLua Injector

ZLua Injector is a simple and effective tool for injecting DLLs into processes on Windows. It's tested specifically with Garry's Mod (`gmod.exe`), using [Gluasteal](https://github.com/lewisclark/glua-steal) and ZLuaDll (Chromium version).

## Features

- **Auto Process Detection**: Automatically finds and attaches to `gmod.exe`.
- **Custom DLL Support**: Option to inject your own DLL if the default one isn't found.
- **User-Friendly**: Clear console messages guide you through the process.

## How to Use

1. **Compile**: Build the injector with a C++ compiler.
2. **Run**: Execute the injector and follow the prompts.
3. **Inject**: Wait for `gmod.exe` to start and inject the DLL.
